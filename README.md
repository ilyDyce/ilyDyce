I am Aiden. I go to an arts school and study Jazz music. Related to coding I took AP CSP and passed with a 3. I am taking AP CSA and I'm interested in diving deeper into the coding world.
I want to work on coding projects monthly during this school year.
I'll post my work here likely. 
I want coding to be my main hobby.
